# Changelog

## [2.2.0] - 2025-01-XX

### New Features

#### Query Result Caching
- **Built-in query caching system**: Dramatically improves performance for repeated searches
  - SQLite-based persistent cache storage survives PHP restarts
  - Automatic cache invalidation on insert/update/delete operations
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction when cache size limit is reached
  - Configurable TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries
  - Hit tracking and statistics for monitoring cache effectiveness
  
- **Performance improvements**: 10-100x faster for cached queries
  - First query: 5-30ms (depending on complexity)
  - Cached query: 0.1-0.5ms
  - No impact on indexing performance
  - Minimal memory overhead (cache stored in SQLite table)
  
- **Cache management API**:
  - `getCacheStats()` - Get hit rate, total entries, and other metrics
  - `clearCache()` - Manually clear cache for an index
  - `warmUpCache()` - Pre-populate cache with common queries
  - `getCacheInfo()` - Detailed cache entry information
  
- **Configuration options**:
  ```php
  'cache' => [
      'enabled' => false,    // Disabled by default for backward compatibility
      'ttl' => 300,         // 5 minutes default TTL
      'max_size' => 1000    // Maximum cached queries per index
  ]
  ```

#### Pre-chunked Document Support
- **Custom document chunking**: Documents can now provide their own chunks instead of relying on automatic chunking
  - Simple mode: Provide an array of string chunks
  - Structured mode: Provide chunks with content and custom metadata
  - Enables semantic chunking at paragraph/section boundaries
  - Preserves document structure (headings, subsections)
  - Each chunk can have its own metadata (section, heading level, etc.)
- **Mixed chunking modes**: Pre-chunked and auto-chunked documents can coexist in the same index
- **Better search relevance**: Keep related content together for improved search accuracy

#### Enhanced Fuzzy Search with Modern Typo Correction
- **Modern search engine behavior**: Automatic typo correction like Google and Elasticsearch
  - Multi-algorithm consensus scoring using 5 different similarity algorithms
  - Phonetic matching for sound-alike typos (fone→phone, thier→their)
  - Keyboard proximity analysis for fat-finger errors (qyick→quick)
  - Configurable sensitivity and precision thresholds
  - Enabled by default for improved user experience

- **Multi-algorithm consensus scoring**:
  - Trigram similarity (25% weight) - Good for overall similarity
  - Levenshtein distance (20% weight) - Good for edit distance
  - Jaro-Winkler similarity (25% weight) - Good for short strings and prefixes
  - Phonetic matching (15% weight) - Good for sound-alike typos

      'correction_threshold' => 0.6,      // Balance sensitivity and precision
      'trigram_threshold' => 0.35,        // Improved matching for partial words
      'fuzzy_score_penalty' => 0.25,      // Reduced penalty for fuzzy matches
  ]
  ```

- **Performance improvements**: 
  - Consensus scoring with early validation for faster processing
  - Improved frequency weighting for better correction accuracy
  - Cached indexed terms for reduced database queries

## [2.1.0] - 2024-01-04

### Major Improvements

#### Search Result Quality & Consistency
- **Fixed fuzzy search inconsistency**: Exact matches now consistently rank higher than fuzzy matches
  - Restructured query building to use NEAR queries and parentheses for exact match prioritization
  - Query structure: `(exact_phrase OR NEAR(exact_terms)) OR (fuzzy_terms)`
  - Enhanced fuzzy penalty calculation with graduated penalties based on match quality
  - Added configuration options: `exact_match_boost` (default: 2.0), `exact_terms_boost` (default: 1.5)
  
#### Field Weighting Effectiveness
- **Significantly improved field weighting**: Documents with matches in high-weight fields (title, h1) now rank much higher
  - Enhanced `calculateFieldWeightedScore()` with exact match detection
  - Added exponential scaling for more pronounced score differences
  - Increased candidate pool size from 200-500 to 1000-5000 documents
  - Primary field detection gives extra boost to title, h1, name fields
  - Perfect field match: 100+ point boost
  - Exact phrase in field: 50+ point boost
  - Proximity bonuses for terms close together

#### Multi-Column FTS (Default Enabled)
- **Native BM25 field weighting**: Now enabled by default for better performance
  - Separate FTS columns per field for native SQLite BM25 weighting
  - ~5% faster than single-column mode (6.76ms vs 7.09ms average)
  - Toggle available via `multi_column_fts` configuration
  - Automatic fallback to post-processing weights in single-column mode
  - Backward compatible with existing indexes

#### Two-Pass Search Strategy (Optional)
- **Primary field prioritization**: Optional two-pass search for maximum precision
  - First pass searches primary fields (title, h1) with doubled weights
  - Second pass searches all fields and merges results
  - Toggle via `two_pass_search` configuration (default: false for performance)
  - Configuration: `primary_fields` and `primary_field_limit`

### Configuration
- Multi-column FTS now **enabled by default** for new indexes
- New default search configuration options:
  ```php
  'multi_column_fts' => true,      // Use separate FTS columns (better performance)
  'exact_match_boost' => 2.0,      // Multiplier for exact phrase matches
  'exact_terms_boost' => 1.5,      // Multiplier for all exact terms present
  'fuzzy_score_penalty' => 0.5,    // Penalty factor for fuzzy-only matches
  'two_pass_search' => false,      // Enable two-pass search (optional)
  'primary_fields' => ['title', 'h1', 'name', 'label'],
  'primary_field_limit' => 100
  ```

### Performance Improvements
- A/B testing results show multi-column FTS provides best performance:
  - Baseline: 7.09ms average
  - Multi-column FTS: **6.76ms average** ✨
  - Two-pass search: 16.36ms average (higher precision, lower speed)
  - Combined: 16.86ms average

### Migration Notes
- Existing indexes continue to work with single-column mode
- To upgrade existing indexes to multi-column FTS:
  1. Recreate the index with `multi_column_fts => true`
  2. Re-index your documents
- No code changes required for basic usage

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-01

### Fuzzy Search UX & Performance
- Added `fuzzy_last_token_only` to focus typo tolerance on the final term (ideal for as‑you‑type search).
- Adaptive n‑gram: trigram search now uses bigrams for short tokens to improve recall on short typos.
- Levenshtein prefiltering: added length/edge‑char/bigram gating to cut false positives and speed up distance checks.
- Similarity‑aware scoring maintained: fuzzy penalty scales by similarity/distance.

### Type‑Ahead & Prefix Support
- Optional `prefix_last_token` to apply `*` to the last token (requires FTS5 prefix indexes).
- New migration script `scripts/migrate_fts.php` to rebuild an index with multi‑column FTS and optional prefix settings.

### Storage & Ranking
- Optional multi-column FTS5: `indexer.fts.multi_column=true` stores per-field text and enables weighted `bm25(fts, w_title, w_content, ...)` from field boosts.
- Optional FTS5 prefix indexing: `indexer.fts.prefix=[2,3]` for strict prefix matches.
- Backward compatible: single-column `content` remains default; schema only changes when opting in.

### External-Content Schema (Doc ID)
- Added first-class support for an external-content schema with integer `doc_id` primary keys and `id TEXT UNIQUE` mapping.
- FTS5 tables now support `content='<index>'` and `content_rowid='doc_id'` modes for better performance and clarity.
- Migration helper: `SqliteStorage::migrateToExternalContent()` converts legacy indices, recreates spatial tables, and rebuilds FTS.
- Tests cover external-content schema creation, migration, and geo queries.

### Geo Search
- Accurate distances: Haversine great‑circle distance (meters) when SQLite math functions are available; fallback to planar approximation otherwise.
- SQL radius filtering: `near` now filters by radius in SQL using the computed distance.
- Dateline handling: bounds crossing the antimeridian (west > east) correctly include both sides.
- Tests: added integration tests for Haversine accuracy and dateline‑crossing bounds.
- k‑Nearest Neighbors (k‑NN): `geoFilters.nearest` returns the k closest documents by distance, with optional `max_distance` clamp and units.
- Distance facets: request `facets.distance` with `from`, `ranges`, and optional `units` to get bucketed counts (e.g., `<= 1 km`, `<= 5 km`, ...).
- Candidate cap: `geoFilters.candidate_cap` limits R-tree candidates for PHP-side distance sorting.
- Result metadata: add `distance_units`, `bearing`, and `bearing_cardinal` (when distance context is available).
 - Fix: R-tree availability probe corrected (valid 2D table) so environments with R-tree are detected properly.
 - Fix: post-filter handling of `near.radius` respects `geoFilters.units` (km/mi/meters) in PHP-side filtering.

### Docs & Examples
- README: Type‑Ahead Setup, Weighted FTS + Prefix sections with examples.
- Added `docs/architecture-overview.md`.
- Added `AGENTS.md` contributor guide.
- README (Geo): Units, composite scoring, distance facets, and k‑NN usage.
- Examples: `examples/geo-facets-knn.php` (distance facets + nearest demo).
- Benchmarks: `benchmarks/geo-benchmark.php` now supports units and `iters`; optional facets output via extra arg.

### Suggestions
- Smarter ranking for `suggest()`: aggregates across variants, boosts titles that contain or start with the variant.
- New options: `limit`, `per_variant`, `title_boost`, `prefix_boost`.

### Synonyms
- Query‑time synonyms expansion: enable via `search.enable_synonyms` and provide a map in `search.synonyms` (array or JSON file).
- Supports multi‑word synonyms (added as quoted phrases), case‑insensitive by default.
- Limits expansions with `search.synonyms_max_expansions` to protect performance.

### Tests & Benchmarks
- Integration tests for fuzzy algorithms and as‑you‑type mode.
- New coverage for geo Haversine accuracy and dateline-crossing bounds (no longer skipped when R-tree is available).
- External-content tests: schema verification, migration, geo distance, and mixed-mode behaviors.
- Indexer tests: chunking, stored-only fields, queued inserts with manual flush, update/delete in legacy and external schemas, rebuild and stats.
- Storage tests: metadata JSON filters for `=, !=, >, <, >=, <=, in, contains, exists`; multi-index merged search.
- SearchEngine tests: distance weighting influence, route de-duplication, suggestions path, distance facets path.

### Tooling & Dev Experience
- Deep-merge configuration in `YetiSearch` so nested options override safely without dropping defaults.
- Makefile targets for coverage: `test-coverage`, `test-coverage-html`, `test-coverage-clover`, `coverage-top`, and `coverage-info`.
- Helper script `scripts/coverage_top_gaps.php` to print lowest-covered files from Clover.
- Local evaluation script: `benchmarks/fuzzy-eval.php`.
